# BtH_ratios v0.1
Python package calculating byproduct-to-host ratio in deposits

## Potential uses of Byproducts_host package
This package enable to determine the potential host(s) element(s) in a given deposit relatively to its contribution to total revenues, when this latter is above a defined threshold (here 20%).
Once the host is determined, it calculates both the "available", "accessible" and "potentially accessible" byproduct-to-host ratio i.e. the quantity of byproduct (in kg) linked to the extraction of 1 kg of host.
